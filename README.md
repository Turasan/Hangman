# Hangman
Hangman is a timeless game that tests your ability to guess a hidden word letter by letter. One player enters a word or phrase, and the other player must guess the letters one by one. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn. The guessing player wins if they correctly identify the word before the hangman is fully drawn, and the word-entering player wins if the hangman is completed.
